## Introduction 
_MTM_ is a multi-tenant management system that handles setting up users, authenticating them, and authorizing them for program access. 

As the owner of a tenant, _MTM_ allows for you to invite an employee, making them users under your tenancy. 
To authenticate a user, _MTM_ returns a [JSON Web Token (JWT)](https://jwt.io), identifying the user's permissions. 

## MTM SDK
The [MTM Client](https://github.com/simplify9/Mtm/blob/master/SW.Mtm.Sdk/MtmClient.cs) outlines the steps the user takes to enable _MTM_ onto the program and interact with its many properties:
 
#### Creating the tenant 
The first step is to create a tenant by calling the `CreateTenant` method provided by the SDK, which takes in details in the model of `TenantCreate` and includes the tenant's name for example.
