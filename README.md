## Introduction 
_Mtm_ is a multi-tenant management system that handles setting up users, authenticating them, and authorizing them for program access. 

As the owner of a tenant, _Mtm_ allows for you to invite an employee, making them users under your tenancy. 
To authenticate a user, _Mtm_ returns a [JSON Web Token](https://jwt.io), identifying the user's permissions.
